# Tic-tac-toe - console game app
This project was created as part of the Java learning process on the Jet Brains Academy platform - hyperskill.org.
When the game starting, you need to enter the coordinates alternately in range 1 to 3. Coordinates numbers from 1 to 3 are assigned to the appropriate cells in belowed grid, where after entering them into the console we first put an "X" then an "O".

Cells coordinates to enter "X" and "O":
Cell | Cell | Cell
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| (1, 3) | (2, 3) | (3, 3) |
| (1, 2) | (2, 2) | (3, 2) | 
| (1, 1) | (2, 1) | (3, 1) |
