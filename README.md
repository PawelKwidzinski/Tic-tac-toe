# Tic-tac-toe - console game app
This project was created as part of the Java learning process on the Jet Brains Academy platform - hyperskill.org.
When starting the game, you have to give the coordinates alternately. Coordinate parameters in the form of numbers from 1 to 3 are assigned to the appropriate cells, where after entering them into the console we first put an "X" then an "O".

(1, 1) | (2, 1) | (3, 1)
